# Drum Kit

This is the first project from the **JavaScript30 Challenge by Wes Bos**.  
Itâ€™s a fun little drum kit app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where you can press keys on your keyboard to play drum sounds with a cool animation.

## Features
- Press **Aâ€“L keys** on your keyboard to play different drum sounds.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** â€“ Structure of the app  
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Event handling and audio playback

## What I Learned
- How to use **data-** attributes to connect HTML elements with JavaScript.
- Handling keyboard events (**keydown**) to trigger actions.
- Using CSS transitions and listening for **transitionend** events in JavaScript.
- Resetting audio playback with **audio.currentTime = 0** so sounds can overlap.
